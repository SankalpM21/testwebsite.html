 Born as the half-Asgardian, half-Elder God son of Odin, the All-Father and King of Asgard, and as the Norse God of Thunder, Thor was an adventurous yet ill-tempered deity, often travelling to other realms to do battle with Asgard’s foes. He spent much of his time in Midgard in particular, or our Earth, fighting as the mythic Germanic hero Siegfried and battling the ancient mutant, Apocalypse.

     As he became more arrogant, it became apparent to Odin that his son needed to learn the value of humility. To do so, he stripped Thor of his powers and memories, rendering him human and stranding him on Earth.

   <h3>Life on Earth</h3>
<p >
 On his arrival to the Midgard, Thor is found by mortals who were trying to understand the science behind the Einstein-rosen bridge (or as they call it in Asgard the 'Bifrost') which teleported Thor into this realm.
 Stripped of his powers and banished to Earth, Thor sets on a journey to return to all his might and glory and regain his 'worthiness.'
   Just when he hears about a 'satellite' which came crashing to the ground and looks like a hammer but no one is able to lift it.
   Thor identifies it as his beloved <em>Mjölnir</em>, he sets out to claim his worth as the god of thunder accompanied by a mortal, Jane Foster.

     Thor finally reaches to the spot where his beloved <em>Mjölnir</em> crashed. After several attempts Thor is unable to lift his hammer. He is truly 'unworthy' as said by Odin-All-Father

    Jane meets Thor after he was banished by Odin and stripped of his powers. Thor is the fish out of water on Earth, relying on the astrophysicist to help him find his hammer and his worthiness. They bond over the course of the movie, drawing closer to each other as they bring out their softer sides. 
    <br> <br>
    Later on, when Thor finds out Jane is cursed he brings him to Asgard and introduces her to the realm of gods, his kingdom, and family.
